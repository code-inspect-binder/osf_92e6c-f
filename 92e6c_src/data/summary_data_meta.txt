Metadata for "summary_data.csv". Partially filled summary file which includes some information on variables compiled from non-primary data sources such as body masses, TEE for Hadza/Tsimane, daily energetic subsistence costs for non-human great apes, etc. -- an associated code file fills in remaining gaps in this table with estimates based on models and original data sources used in this paper. NOTE: Human data (for Tsimane and Hadza) are subject to a Materials Transfer Agreement and are not publicly available. Contact Michael Gurven (UCSB) and Brian Wood (UCLA) for more information.

Species: species.
Sex: sex.
mass: Body mass in kilograms.
TEE: Total energy expenditure in kilocalories, as measured by doubly-labeled water.
TEE_high: Upper 95% CI of TEE.
TEE_low: Lower 95% CI of TEE.
cost: Energy cost of subsistence per day (in kcal).
hi.cost: Upper 95% CI of cost.
low.cost: Lower 95% CI of cost.
prod: Daily energy acquired (in kcal).
time_forage_and_moving: Time spent on subsistence activities per day (in hours). For non-human great apes this encompasses time spent foraging and moving between feeding sites. Comparable values for humans encompass the broad range of activities described in the main paper.
hi.prod: Upper 95% CI of prod.
low.prod: Lower 95% CI of prod.
body_fat: Average percent body fat, expressed as a proportion.
body_fat_ref: Reference study from which body fat % was derived.
